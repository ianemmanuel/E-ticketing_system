This project is an E-ticketing system developed using the django web framework.
The system allows its users to purchase tickets for different types of events nd recommends the same based on their preferences by using a filtering functionality embedded onto the system.
There are two types of users in the system, a regular ticket buyer and an event organizer. Various permissions and features are accessible to the users based on their level of authentication.
Ticket purchasing is handled by the PayPal API.
